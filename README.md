# RandomSearchDL_Thesis

This repository contains the source code used for the random search of the deep learning models in my Ph.D. thesis.

The root directory contains simulation scripts named according to the time series used. For example, [01_MackeyGlass.py]([https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/nfisis_thesis/blob/ae0b27feaaba2b442db9bf5693183d9d37ecf261/01_MackeyGlass.py](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/RandomSearchDL_Thesis/blob/0f02007a60b6f71c517d9a4cc42a093e6846824d/01_MackeyGlass.py)) contains the simulations for the random search of Mackey-Glass time series.

The source code of the final simulations can be found at [nfisis_thesis](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/nfisis_thesis.git)
